# Eat-Da-Burger!
* This app is a restaurant game that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* This app follows the MVC paradigm. Short for Model View Controller, MVC is an architectural pattern that structures our codebase in three distinct sections according to a software design philosophy known as the _separation of concerns_. 
* This is my first full stack project which allows the user to create, update and delete data.
